*pre-release draft.   still thinking about this approach*

The W3C [Linked Data Platform 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/REC-ldp-20150226/) was a reasonable start, but it wasn't nearly enough if we want to actually separate applications from data.

The idea of **LDPx** is to continue and expand on the LDP idea that data should live on web servers, separable from applications, until we actually have an platform suitable for a vast range of applications.

The "x" stands for the next version, and *extensions*, and an *exchange* point for many different approaches and technologies.

LDPx builds on the spirit of LDP 1.0, but is not at all constrainted to be compatible or even use a similar technology stack.   Even blockchain technologies are welcome here, when framed in the LDPx model.

The LDPx model: applications are separable from data.   Users are never locked into an application by technological barriers; they can use other applications to access the same data, including other users' data.

This work comes out of the [Crosscloud Projects](http://crosscloud.org).   [Solid](https://github.com/solid/solid) is imagined to be a selection of relatively-stable LDPx behaviors, implemented by a set of servers and applications.
